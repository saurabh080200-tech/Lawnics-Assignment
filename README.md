# STEPS NEEDED TO EXECUTE THE PROBLEM :

Removing Punctutation
Applying Lemmatizer
is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item,identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form.

## 4.Tags Generation

Using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

NMF approximates a matrix X with a low-rank matrix approximation such that it gives two non-negative matrices (W, H) whose product approximates the non- negative matrix X. H provides the association for the topics with the words W tells us which topic is promminent in which scenario
